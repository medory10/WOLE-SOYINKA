            <p>
                Akinwande Oluwole Babatunde Soyinka (Yoruba: Aknwándé Olwlé Babátndé
                óyinká; born 13 July 1934), also known as Wole Soyinka (pronounced
                [wlé ójnká]), is a Nigerian playwright, novelist, poet, and essayist.
                He was the first person to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature in
                1986. Soyinka has been a vocal critic of successive Nigerian (and
                African) governments, particularly the country's many military
                dictators, as well as other political tyrants such as Zimbabwe's

                    Mugabe</a> regime. <br /><br />He has written extensively about "the
                oppressive boot and the irrelevance of the color of the foot that
                wears it." Soyinka fled Nigeria on a motorcycle via the "NADECO Route"
                during the regime of General Sani Abacha (1993-98). Later, Abacha
                issued a death sentence against him "in absentia." Soyinka returned to
                Nigeria after civilian rule was restored in 1999. Soyinka described
                2020 as the most difficult year in the country's history in December
                2020. "With the turbulence that marked the year 2020, and as
                activities wind down," he said. Soyinka taught comparative literature
                in Nigeria from 1975 until 1999 at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obafemi_Awolowo_University"
                    target="_blank">obafemi Awolowo University,</a> which
                was formerly known as the University of Ife. He was named a professor
                emeritus after Nigeria returned to civilian rule in 1999. During his
                time in the US, he first held the position of Goldwin Smith Professor
                for African Studies and Theatre Arts at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University"
                    target="_blank">Cornell University </a> from 1988
                to 1991 before moving on to Emory University, where he was named
                Robert W. Woodruff Professor of the Arts in 1996. Soyinka has held
                academic positions at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles,
                California, and the Institute of African American Affairs at New York
                University. He currently teaches creative writing at the <a

            <p>
                Personal life Soyinka has been married three times and divorced twice.
                He has 8 children from his three marriages and 2 other daughters. His
                first marriage was in 1958 to the late British writer Barbara Dixon,
                whom he met at the University of Leeds in the 1950s. Barbara was the
                mother of his first son, Olaokun. Then his daughter Morenike. His
                second marriage was in 1963 to Nigerian librarian Olaide Idowu, with
                whom he had three daughters – Moremi, Iyetade (deceased),[95] Peyibomi
                – and a second son, Ilemakin. Soyinka youngest daughter is Amani.
                Soyinka married Folake Doherty in 1989. They have three sons, Tunlewa,
                Bojode and Eniara. In 2014, he revealed his battle with prostate
                cancer Soyinka, an Isara dynasty descendent, was born in the city of
                Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria, then a British colony, as the second of
                seven children. Atinuke "Tinu" Aina Soyinka, Femi, Yeside, Omofolabo
                "Folabo" Ajayi-Soyinka, and Kayode Soyinka were his siblings.
                Folashade Soyinka, his younger sister, passed away on her first
                birthday. Samuel Ayodele Soyinka, his father, was the headmaster of
                St. Peters School in Abokuta and an Anglican pastor who went by the
                nickname "Essay" or "S.A." The elder Soyinka had strong ties to his
                family and was related to Nigeria's founding father, Samuel Akinsanya,
                who was the Odemo, or King, of Isara-Remo. Grace Eniola Soyinka, often
                known as the "Wild Christian," was Soyinka's mother and had a store in
                the neighborhood. She participated in the local women's movement as a
                political activist. Also an Anglican, she.<br /><br /> As a large portion of the
                neighborhood practiced the indigenous Yorùbá religion, Soyinka grew up
                in a syncretic religious environment that combined elements of both
                traditions. Despite coming from a religious background and growing up
                participating in the choir, Soyinka subsequently came to reject
                religion for himself.Due to the position of his father, he had access
                to radio and power at home. In his autobiography Aké: The Years of
                Childhood, he goes into great detail about his upbringing (1981).<br /><br />
                On September 7, 2019, Soyinka will perform at the Festivaletteratura
                in Mantua. One of the most well-known members of the powerful

                Seun Kuti, and Yeni Kuti, all artists, are his second cousins. His
                younger brother Femi Soyinka went on to become a doctor and a
                professor at a university. Reverend Canon As the sole child of his

                Soyinka, his younger brother, became a medical doctor and a university
                professor. After graduating from St. Peter's Primary School in
                Abeokuta in 1940, Soyinka enrolled at Abeokuta Grammar School, where
                he received numerous literary composition awards. He was admitted in
                1946 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_College,_Ibadan" target="_blank"> government
                    College </a>in ibadan, one of the most prestigious
                secondary schools in Nigeria at the time.<br /><br /> He began his studies at
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Ibadan" target="_blank"> University College Ibadan
                </a> (1952–1954), a school connected to the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_London" target="_blank"> University of London </a>,
                after completing his course at Government
                College in 1952. He researched Western history, Greek, and English
                literature. A British literary expert named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Mahood"
                    target="_blank"> Molly Mahood </a> was one of
                his lecturers. Soyinka started working on "Keffi's Birthday Treat," a
                little radio drama for the Nigerian Broadcasting Service, in the
                academic year 1953–54, his second and final at University College.<br /><br /> The
                play was broadcast in July 1954. Soyinka and six other students
                established the The first fraternity in Nigeria is called <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Seadogs" target="_blank"> Pyrates
                    Confraternity;</a> it is an anti-corruption and justice-seeking student
                organization.  Later in 1954, Soyinka moved to England, where he
                pursued his studies in English literature at the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Leeds" target="_blank"> University of Leeds </a>
                (1954–1957) under the guidance of his mentor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Wilson_Knight"
                    target="_blank"> Wilson Knight </a>. He met
                several up-and-coming, talented British writers. Soyinka started
                writing and editing for a parody magazine called The Eagle before
                defending his B.A. He authored a section on academic life in which he
                repeatedly criticized his university peers. Soyinka stayed in Leeds
                after graduating with an upper second-class degree and began working
                on an MA. He intended to write new works that blended European
                theatrical traditions with his Yorùbá cultural heritage. His first
                major play, The Swamp Dwellers (1958), was followed a year later by
                The Lion and the Jewel, a comedy that piqued the interest of several
                Royal Court Theatre members. Encouraged, Soyinka relocated to London
                to work as a play reader at the Royal Court Theatre. Both of his plays
                were performed in Ibadan at the same time.They addressed Nigeria's
                tense relationship between progress and tradition. His play The
                Invention was the first of his works to be staged at the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Court_Theatre" target="_blank"> Royal Court Theatre </a>
                in 1957. His only published works at the time were poems such as "The Immigrant" and "My Next Door
                Neighbor," which appeared in the Nigerian magazine Black Orpheus. <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulli_Beier" target="_blank">Ulli Beier</a>, a German scholar who
                had been teaching at the University of Ibadan since 1950,
                founded this in 1957.  Soyinka returned to Nigeria after receiving a Rockefeller
                Research Fellowship from his alma mater, University College in Ibadan,
                for research on African theater. After the fifth issue (November
                1959), Soyinka took over as coeditor of the literary journal Black
                Orpheus (named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre" target="_blank"> Jean-Paul
                    Sartre's </a> 1948 essay "Orphée Noir"
                published in the journal). In April 1960, he premiered his new satire,
                The Trials of Brother Jero, in the dining hall of University College
                Ibadan's Mellanby Hall. That same year, his play A Dance of the
                Forest, a biting critique of Nigeria's political elites, won a
                competition to be the official play for Nigerian Independence Day. It
                premiered in Lagos on October 1, 1960, as Nigeria celebrated its
                independence. The play satirizes the fledgling nation by demonstrating
                that the present is no better than the past. Also in 1960, Soyinka
                founded the "Ninety-Sixty Masks," an amateur acting the next few
                years.

                Soyinka penned the first full-length play to be broadcast on Nigerian
                television. The play, titled My Father's Burden and directed by<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olusegun_Olusola" target="_blank"> Segun Olusola </a>, debuted
                on Western Nigeria Television (WNTV) on August 6,
                1960. As his Yorùbá homeland was increasingly occupied and controlled
                by the federal government, Soyinka published works satirizing the
                "Emergency" in Nigeria's Western Region. Political tensions resulting
                from the country's recent postcolonial independence eventually led to
                a military coup and civil war (1967-1970). Soyinka purchased a Land
                Rover with the Rockefeller grant and began traveling throughout the
                country as a researcher with the Department of English Language at the
                University College of Ibadan. In a contemporaneous essay, he
                criticized<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9opold_S%C3%A9dar_Senghor" target="_blank">
                    Leopold Senghor's</a> Négritude movement as a nostalgic and
                indiscriminate glorification of the past.He is frequently quoted as
                saying, "A tiger does not proclaim his tigritude; he pounces."
                However, in a 1960 essay for the Horn, Soyinka wrote, "the duiker will
                not paint 'duiker' on his beautiful back to proclaim his duikeritude;
                you'll know him by his elegant leap." "The elephant trails no
                tethering-rope; that king is not yet crowned who will peg an
                elephant," he says in Death and the King's Horsemen.Soyinka's essay
                "Towards a True Theater" was published in December 1962.<br /><br /> He began
                teaching at Obafemi Awolowo University's Department of English
                Language in If. He discussed current events with "négrophiles" and
                openly condemned government censorship on several occasions. Culture
                in Transition, his first feature-length film, was released at the end
                of 1963. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Deutsch" target="_blank">André Deutsch</a>
                published The Interpreters, a "complex but
                vividly documentary novel," in London in 1965. That December, Soyinka
                co-founded the Drama Association of Nigeria with scientists and
                theater professionals. In 1964, he also resigned from his university
                position in protest of the authorities' imposed pro-government
                behavior.<br /><br />
                A few months later, in 1965, he was arrested for the first time,
                accused of holding up a radio station with a gun (as described in his
                2006 memoir You Must Set Forth at Dawn) and replacing a tape of a
                recorded speech by Western Nigeria's premier with a different tape
                containing accusations of election malpractice. Soyinka was released
                after a few months of confinement as a result of international writer
                protests. During the same year, he wrote two more dramatic pieces:
                Before the Blackout and After the Blackout Kongi's Harvest is a
                comedy. He also wrote The Detainee, a BBC radio play in London. His
                play The Road premiered at the Commonwealth Arts Festival in London on
                September 14, 1965, at the Theatre Royal. He was promoted to
                headmaster and senior lecturer in the Department of English Language
                at the University of Lagos at the end of the year. At the time,
                Soyinka's political speeches criticized the cult of personality and
                government corruption in African dictatorships. Kongi's Harvest was
                revived in April 1966 at the World Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar,
                Senegal. The Road received the Grand Prix. In June 1965, his play
                The Trials of Brother Jero was staged at London's Hampstead Theatre
                Club. Civil war and incarceration Soyinka became more politically
                active after becoming Chair of Drama at the University of Ibadan.
                Following the January 1966 military coup, he secretly and unofficially
                met with military governor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Odumegwu_Ojukwu" target="_blank">
                    Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu </a>in the southern
                town of Enugu (August 1967) to try to avert Nigeria's civil war.
                [Citation required] As a result, he was forced to flee. As a result of
                the civil war between the Federal Government of Nigeria and the
                Biafrans, he was imprisoned for 22 months 59. Despite being denied
                books, pens, and paper, he wrote a significant body of poems and notes
                criticizing the Nigerian government while imprisoned. Despite his
                confinement, his play The lion and the Jewel was staged in Accra,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana" target="_blank"> Ghana</a>, in 2008. Despite his
                imprisonment, his play The Lion and the
                Jewel was staged in September 1967 in Accra, Ghana.<br /><br /> The Trials of
                Brother Jero and The Strong Breed were staged in New York City's
                Greenwich Mews Theatre in November of that year. Soyinka also
                published Idanre and Other Poems, a collection of his poetry inspired
                by his visit to the sanctuary of the Yorùbá deity Ogun, whom he

                Kongi's Harvest was staged by the Negro Ensemble Company in New York
                in 1968. While still imprisoned, Soyinka translated from Yoruba the
                fantastical novel The Forest of a Thousand Demons: A Hunter's Saga by
                his compatriot <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_O._Fagunwa" target="_blank"> D. O. Fagunwa

                In 1974, his Collected Plays, Volume II was issued by Oxford
                University Press. In 1975 Soyinka was promoted to the position of
                editor for Transition, a magazine based in the Ghanaian capital of
                Accra, where he moved for some time. He used his columns in Transition
                to criticise the "negrophiles" (for instance, his article
                "Neo-Tarzanism: The Poetics of Pseudo-Transition") and military
                regimes. He protested against the military junta of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idi_Amin"
                    target="_blank"> Idi Amin</a> in
                Uganda. After the political turnover in Nigeria and the subversion of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakubu_Gowon" target="_blank"> Gowon's</a> military regime in
                1975, Soyinka returned to his homeland and
                resumed his position as Chair of Comparative Literature at the
                University of Ife.<br /><br /> In 1976, he published his poetry collection Ogun
                Abibiman, as well as a collection of essays entitled Myth, Literature
                and the African World. In these, Soyinka explores the genesis of
                mysticism in African theatre and, using examples from both European
                and African literature, compares and contrasts the cultures. He
                delivered a series of guest lectures at the Institute of African
                Studies at the University of Ghana in Legon. In October, the French
                version of The Dance of The Forests was performed in<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakar"
                    target="_blank"> Dakar</a>, while in
                Ife, his play Death and The King's Horseman premièred. In 1977, Opera
                Wọnyọsi, his adaptation of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertolt Brecht" target="_blank">
                    Bertolt Brecht's</a> The Threepenny Opera, was
                staged in Ibadan. In 1979 he both directed and acted in<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon"
                    target="_blank"> Jon Blair </a> and
                Norman Fenton's drama The Biko Inquest, a work based on the life of
                Steve Biko, a South African student and human rights activist who was
                beaten to death by apartheid police forces.In 1981 Soyinka published
                his autobiographical work Aké: The Years of Childhood, which won a
                1983 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award. Soyinka founded another theatrical
                group called the Guerrilla Unit.<br /><br /> Its goal was to work with local
                communities in analysing their problems and to express some of their
                grievances in dramatic sketches. In 1983 his play Requiem for a
                Futurologist had its first performance at the University of Ife. In
                July, one of his musical projects, the Unlimited Liability Company,
                issued a long-playing record entitled I Love My Country, on which
                several prominent Nigerian musicians played songs composed by Soyinka.
                In 1984, he directed the film Blues for a Prodigal, which was screened
                at the University of Ife. His A Play of Giants was produced the same
                year. During the years 1975–84, Soyinka was more politically active.
                At the University of Ife, his administrative duties included the
                security of public roads. He criticized the corruption in the
                government of the democratically elected President<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shehu_Shagari"
                    target="_blank"> Shehu Shagari</a> . When
                he was replaced by the army general<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammadu_Buhari"
                    target="_blank"> Muhammadu Buhari,</a> Soyinka was
                often at odds with the military.<br /><br />
                In 1984, a Nigerian court banned his 1972 book The Man Died: Prison
                Notes. In 1985, his play Requiem for a Futurologist was published in
                London by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Collings" target="_blank"> Rex Collings.</a> Soyinka
                called for the cancellation of
                Nigeria's presidential elections two weeks earlier, which had been
                marred by widespread fraud and violence. Following the attempted
                bombing of a Northwest Airlines flight to the United States by a
                Nigerian student radicalized in Britain, Soyinka questioned the
                British government's social logic in allowing every religion to openly
                proselytise their faith, claiming that it was being abused by
                religious fundamentalists, turning England into, in his opinion, a
                breeding ground for extremism.<br /><br /> He supported religious freedom but
                warned against the unintended consequences of allowing religions to
                preach apocalyptic violence. Soyinka called for the cancellation of

                described in the Financial Times as "a brutally satirical look at
                power and corruption in Nigeria, told in the form of a whodunnit
                involving three university friends." Reviewing the book in The
                Guardian, Ben Okri said: "It is Soyinka's greatest novel, his revenge
                against the insanities of the nation's ruling class and one of the
                most shocking chronicles of an African nation in the 21st century. It
                ought to be widely read."<br /><br />
                In April 2007, Soyinka called for the cancellation of the Nigerian
                presidential elections held two weeks earlier, beset by widespread
                fraud and violence. In the wake of the attempting bombing on a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Airlines" target="_blank"> Northwest Airlines</a>
                flight to the United States by a Nigerian student
                who had become radicalised in Britain, Soyinka questioned the British
                government's social logic in allowing every religion to openly
                proselytise their faith, asserting that it was being abused by
                religious fundamentalists, thereby turning England into, in his view,
                a cesspit for the breeding of extremism. He supported the freedom of
                worship but warned against the consequence of the illogic of allowing
                religions to preach apocalyptic violence.

            <h1>Release and literary production</h1>
            <p>
                In October 1969, when the civil war came to an end, amnesty was
                proclaimed, and Soyinka and other political prisoners were freed. For
                the first few months after his release, Soyinka stayed at a friend's
                farm in southern France, where he sought solitude. He wrote The
                Bacchae of Euripides (1969), a reworking of the Pentheus myth. He soon
                published in London a book of poetry, Poems from Prison. At the end of
                the year, he returned to his office as Chair of Drama at Ibadan. In
                1970, he produced the play Kongi's Harvest, while simultaneously
                adapting it as a film of the same title. In June 1970, he finished
                another play, called Madmen and Specialists. Together with the group
                of 15 actors of Ibadan University Theatre Art Company, he went on a
                trip to the United States, to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_O'Neill_Theater_Center"
                    target="_blank">Eugene O'Neill Memorial Theatre Center </a>
                in Waterford, Connecticut, where his latest play premiered.<br /><br /> It
                gave them all experience with theatrical production in another
                English-speaking country. In 1971, his poetry collection A Shuttle in
                the Crypt was published. Madmen and Specialists was produced in Ibadan
                that year. Soyinka travelled to Paris to take the lead role as Patrice
                Lumumba, the murdered first Prime Minister of the Republic of the
                Congo, in the production of his Murderous Angels. In April 1971,
                concerned about the political situation in Nigeria, Soyinka resigned
                from his duties at the University in Ibadan, and began years of
                voluntary exile. In July in Paris, excerpts from his well-known play
                The Dance of The Forests were performed. Oxford University Press
                published both his novel Season of Anomy and his Collected Plays in
                1972. That same year, his powerful autobiographical work The Man Died,
                a collection of notes from prison, was published. In 1973, he was
                awarded an Honoris Causa doctorate by the University of Leeds. The
                National Theatre in London commissioned and premiered Euripides' play
                The Bacchae in the same year, and his plays Camwood on the Leaves and
                Jero's Metamorphosis were also first published. Soyinka spent time
                studying science from 1973 to 1975. [clarification required] He was a
                visiting fellow at Churchill College,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge"
                target="_blank"> Cambridge University,</a> for a year
                in 1973-74, he wrote Death and the King's Horseman, which received its
                first reading at Churchill College (where Dapo Ladimeji was a
                student). Since 1986 Soyinka in 2015. Soyinka was awarded the Nobel
                Prize for Literature in 1986, becoming the first African laureate. He
                was described as one "who in a wide cultural perspective and with
                poetic overtones fashions the drama of existence". Reed Way Dasenbrock
                writes that the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Soyinka is
                "likely to prove quite controversial and thoroughly deserved". He also
                notes that "it is the first Nobel Prize awarded to an African writer
                or to any writer from the 'new literatures' in English that have
                emerged in the former colonies of the British Empire." His Nobel
                acceptance speech, "This Past Must Address Its Present", was devoted
                to South African freedom-fighter<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela"
                    target="_blank">Nelson Mandela. </a> Soyinka's speech was
                an outspoken criticism of apartheid and the politics of racial
                segregation imposed on the majority by the National South African
                government. In 1986, he received the Agip Prize for Literature. In
                1988, his collection of poems Mandela's Earth, and Other Poems was
                published, while in Nigeria another collection of essays entitled Art,
                Dialogue and Outrage: Essays on Literature and Culture appeared. In
                the same year, Soyinka accepted the position of Professor of African
                Studies and Theatre at Cornell University.<br /><br /> In 1989, a third novel,
                inspired by his father's intellectual circle, Ìsarà: A Voyage Around
                Essay, appeared. In July 1991 the BBC African Service transmitted his
                radio play A Scourge of Hyacinths, and the next year (1992) in Siena
                (Italy), his play From Zia with Love had its premiere. Both works are
                very bitter political parodies, based on events that took place in
                Nigeria in the 1980s. In 1993 Soyinka was awarded an honorary
                doctorate from Harvard University. The next year another part of his
                autobiography appeared: Ibadan: The Penkelemes Years (A Memoir:
                1946–1965).<br /><br />
                The following year his play The Beatification of Area Boy was
                published. In October 1994, he was appointed UNESCO Goodwill
                Ambassador for the Promotion of African culture, human rights, freedom
                of expression, media and communication. Soyinka fled Nigeria in
                November 1994, crossing the border into Benin and then to the United
                States. The Open Sore of a Continent: A Personal Narrative of the
                Nigerian Crisis was first published in 1996. <br /><br />The
                government of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sani Abacha"
                target="_blank">General Sani Abacha </a> charged him with treason in 1997.
                The International Parliament of Writers (IPW) was founded in 1993 to
                assist writers who have been persecuted. From 1997 to 2000, Soyinka
                served as the organization's second president. Outsiders, Soyinka's
                new collection of poems, was published in 1999.<br /><br /> That same year, on BBC
                Radio 3, a BBC-commissioned play called Document of Identity aired,
                telling the lightly fictionalized story of his daughter's family's
                problems during a stopover in Britain when they fled Nigeria for the
                US in 1996; her son, Oseoba Airewele was born in Luton and became a
                stateless person. Soyinka's play King Baabu, a political satire on
                African dictatorship, premiered in Lagos in 2001. Methuen published
                Samarkand and Other Markets I Have Known, a collection of his poems,
                in 2002. Random House published his memoir You Must Set Forth at Dawn
                in April 2006. To protest the Thai military's successful coup against
                the government, he cancelled his keynote speech for the annual S.E.A.
                Write Awards Ceremony in Bangkok in 2006. The Wole Soyinka Annual
                Lecture Series was founded in 1994 and "is dedicated to honouring one
                of Nigeria and Africa's most outstanding and enduring literary icons:
                Professor Wole Soyinka". It is organised by the National Association
                of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity), which organisation Soyinka with
                six other students founded in 1952 at the then University College
                Ibadan.<br /><br /> In 2011, the African Heritage Research Library and Cultural
                Centre built a writers' enclave in his honour. It is located in
                Adeyipo Village, Lagelu Local Government Area, Ibadan, Oyo State,
                Nigeria. The enclave includes a Writer-in-Residence Programme that
                enables writers to stay for a period of two, three or six months,
                engaging in serious creative writing. In 2013, he visited the Benin
                Moat as the representative of UNESCO in recognition of the Naija seven
                Wonders project. He is currently the consultant for the Lagos Black
                Heritage Festival, with the Lagos State deeming him as the only person
                who could bring out the aims and objectives of the Festival to the
                people.He was appointed a patron of Humanists UK in 2020. <br /><br />
                In 2014, the collection Crucible of the Ages: Essays in Honour of Wole
                Soyinka at 80, edited by Ivor Agyeman-Duah and Ogochwuku Promise, was
                published by Bookcraft in Nigeria and Ayebia Clarke Publishing in the
                UK, with tributes and contributions from Nadine Gordimer, Toni
                Morrison, Ama Ata Aidoo, Ngugi wa Thiong’o, Henry Louis Gates, Jr,
                Margaret Busby, Kwame Anthony Appiah, Ali Mazrui, Sefi Atta, and
                others. In 2018, Henry Louis Gates, Jr tweeted that Nigerian filmmaker
                and writer Onyeka Nwelue visited him in Harvard and was making a
                documentary film on Wole Soyinka.[107] As part of efforts to mark his
                84th birthday, a collection of poems titled 84 Delicious Bottles of
                Wine was published for Wole Soyinka, edited by Onyeka Nwelue and Odega
                Shawa. Among the notable contributors was Adamu Usman Garko,
                award-winning teenage essayist, poet and writer.
